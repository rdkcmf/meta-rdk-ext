Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Round SourceBuffer removal range

Round SB removal range provided as 'double' in SB::remove() func
to 1/1000 us.

This helps to avoid cases when unintended frame
would be marked for removal becasue of very small overlap
that could come from precision lost.

It fixes HBOMax issue that uses next sample PTS as removal 'end'
and unexpectedly removes the next segment (as it's a sync frame)

Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Improve logging of sample data to match the rest of MSE
 logs

Use sample.toJSONString() func to log sample data as toFloat()
may print slightly different value because of limitted precision.
