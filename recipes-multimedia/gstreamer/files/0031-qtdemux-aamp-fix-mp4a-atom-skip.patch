Subject: [PATCH] DELIA-39611: fMP4 HLS streams using Widevine/PlayReady not
 playable

     While playing a fragmented MP4 asset with clear and encrypted discontinuous
     fragments, AAMP push init header with pssh data first for initializing decryptor plugins.
     During this, mp4a atom is skipped because stream->protected is not reset in AAMP use-case
