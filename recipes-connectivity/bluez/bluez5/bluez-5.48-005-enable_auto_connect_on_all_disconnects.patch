Subject: [PATCH] NGDEV-100839 - Lost RCU (1.0) paring to the STB while performing Voice Search.

	This patch removes the check on the disconnection reason before starting the passive
	scan.  This fixes an issue where the RCU would disconnect for different reasons not
	covered by ETIMEDOUT, ECONNRESET & ECONNABORTED, and this meant you could never
	reconnect the device unless you manually triggered a scan (i.e. started pairing, or
	power cycled the box).

	Now for any disconnect reason the passive scan will be restarted. However note there
	is a check before this that ensures the device should be auto-connected, this just
	removes the disconnect reason as a stumbling block.
