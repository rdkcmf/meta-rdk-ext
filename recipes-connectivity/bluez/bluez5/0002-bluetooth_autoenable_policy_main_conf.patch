Subject: [PATCH] RDK-22546 RDK-27733 : add main.conf to set AutoEnable=true

        It is learned that the BlueZ is Not turning on the Controller but the HCITool.
        When bluetoothctl is used to pair the HID devices, the first time always fails.
        Figured that Power off and power On using bluetoothctl will fix this as it is originally not turned on by BlueZ.
        So, Implemented main.conf with 'AutoEnable=true' to let the BlueZ to take control over the adapter and turn on when it finds it..
