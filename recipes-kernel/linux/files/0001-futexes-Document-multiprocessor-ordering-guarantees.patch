	That's essential, if you want to hack on futexes.

+ * Basic futex operation and ordering guarantees:
+ *
+ * The waiter reads the futex value in user space and calls
+ * futex_wait(). This function computes the hash bucket and acquires
+ * the hash bucket lock. After that it reads the futex user space value
+ * again and verifies that the data has not changed. If it has not
+ * changed it enqueues itself into the hash bucket, releases the hash
+ * bucket lock and schedules.
+ *
+ * The waker side modifies the user space value of the futex and calls
+ * futex_wake(). This functions computes the hash bucket and acquires
+ * the hash bucket lock. Then it looks for waiters on that futex in the
+ * hash bucket and wakes them.
+ *
+ * Note that the spin_lock serializes waiters and wakers, so that the
+ * following scenario is avoided:
+ *
+ * CPU 0                               CPU 1
+ * val = *futex;
+ * sys_futex(WAIT, futex, val);
+ *   futex_wait(futex, val);
+ *   uval = *futex;
+ *                                     *futex = newval;
+ *                                     sys_futex(WAKE, futex);
+ *                                       futex_wake(futex);
+ *                                       if (queue_empty())
+ *                                         return;
+ *   if (uval == val)
+ *      lock(hash_bucket(futex));
+ *      queue();
+ *     unlock(hash_bucket(futex));
+ *     schedule();
+ *
+ * This would cause the waiter on CPU 0 to wait forever because it
+ * missed the transition of the user space value from val to newval
+ * and the waker did not find the waiter in the hash bucket queue.
+ * The spinlock serializes that:
+ *
+ * CPU 0                               CPU 1
+ * val = *futex;
+ * sys_futex(WAIT, futex, val);
+ *   futex_wait(futex, val);
+ *   lock(hash_bucket(futex));
+ *   uval = *futex;
+ *                                     *futex = newval;
+ *                                     sys_futex(WAKE, futex);
+ *                                       futex_wake(futex);
+ *                                       lock(hash_bucket(futex));
+ *   if (uval == val)
+ *      queue();
+ *     unlock(hash_bucket(futex));
+ *     schedule();                       if (!queue_empty())
+ *                                         wake_waiters(futex);
+ *                                       unlock(hash_bucket(futex));
