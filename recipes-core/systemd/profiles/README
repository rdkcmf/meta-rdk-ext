## RDM systemd profiling ##

Why profile systemd?
systemd is the default init system in RDK devices. systemd is rich in features which comes without saying that it is bulky as well for the same reason. 
By default, systemd is bundled with lot of features and services enabled which might not be really used across all RDK devices. Hence there 
is a compelling need to tailor or tear-down systemd in RDK so that only stuff that is really required at runtime is enabled thereby reducing 
the overall footprint occupied by systemd in the firmware and improving performance too (by removing services that were earlier actively running 
in the device but not used for any real purpose)



## systemd features ##

List of systemd features available - 

importd - Enables VM and container image import and export service
coredump - Acquire, save and process core dumps
gcrypt/bzip2/lz4/zlib - Required when importd is enabled. Probably for image compression/extraction
audit - Used alongside ima feature
manpages - man pages for systemd
cryptsetup - Encrypt block devices
resolved - DNS service
networkd - Network manager
machined - Virtual machine and container registration manager
logind - User login manager
efi - Support for EFI firmware boot
quotacheck - Enabled File system quota check
randomseed - Load and save the system random seed at boot and shutdown
seccomp - Support for secccomp. seccomp is a kernel security feature
journal-upload - Send journal messages over the network
hostnamed - Daemon to control system hostname from programs
timedated - Time and date bus mechanism to change the system clock and timezone
localed - Locale bus mechanism to change the system locale settings, as well as the console key mapping and default X11 key mapping
smack - Enable support for smack. Smack is a Linux kernel security module that protects data and process interaction from malicious manipulation
pam - Register user sessions in the systemd login manager
selinux - Enable selinux support. selinux is a kernel security feature
valgrind - Enable support for valgrind
qrencode/microhttpd/libidn/elfutils - Not much information available. These features are listed as optional in systemd README
firstboot - Initialize basic system settings on or before the first boot-up of a system. The service is started if ConditionFirstBoot=yes is satisfied. 
            This essentially means that /etc/ is empty
binfmt -  Configure additional binary formats for executables in the kernel at boot. Its services are being intentioned removed in RDK layer.
          Services reads configuration files from the above directories to register in the kernel additional binary formats for executables
backlight - Load and save the display backlight brightness at boot and shutdown
hibernate - Responsible for system suspend and hibernate
ima - It stands for Integrit Measurement Architecture - A kernel security feature. This feature might be useful in systemd only when IMA subsystem is enabled in Linux kernel
myhostname - Resolves local hostname to locally configured IP addresses
polkit - polkit is an application-level toolkit for controlling system-wide privileges. In systemd, it is necessary power management as an unprivileged user
rfkill - Restores the RF kill switch state at early boot and saves it on each change
sysusers - Allocate system users and groups
timesyncd - Network Time Synchronization
utmp - Updates login records
xz - Data compression/decompression util

Note - Out of these features, currently timesyncd, utmp & myhostname are the only features being used in RDK and hence enabled. Rest other features are disabled

How to enable a systemd feature?
Add the feature to the PACKAGECONFIG variable



## systemd recommended packages ##

What is RRECOMMENDS?
List of packages that extends the usability of a package being built. The package being built does not depend on this list of packages in order to successfully build, 
but rather uses them for extended usability. Must always use the variable in conjunction with a package name override

How to use RRECOMMENDS?
Add the desired package (belonging to systemd or any other recipe) to RRECOMMENDS_${PN} variable
