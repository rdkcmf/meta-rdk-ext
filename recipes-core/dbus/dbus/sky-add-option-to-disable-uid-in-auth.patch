This patch adds an option to disable sending of the clients user id
as part of the AUTH EXTERNAL process, which causes problems if the client
is in a user namespace different from the dbus-daemon process as the UID
sent in the AUTH message doesn't match the value read from the unix socket.
The following is an example of AUTH handshaking when
SKY_DBUS_DISABLE_UID_IN_EXTERNAL_AUTH is not set (original):
	C: AUTH EXTERNAL 31303030     <-- 31303030 is UID 1000
	S: OK 1234deadbeef
	C: BEGIN
If SKY_DBUS_DISABLE_UID_IN_EXTERNAL_AUTH is set:
	C: AUTH EXTERNAL              <-- Empty auth data
	S: DATA                       <-- Server sends another request for data
	C: DATA                       <-- Client sends back another empty data
                                          Server will revert to just use the socket data
	S: OK 1234deadbeef
	C: BEGIN
Note that there is no reduction in security by setting the
SKY_DBUS_DISABLE_UID_IN_EXTERNAL_AUTH env var.  The server
still uses the SO_PEERCRED which is enforced by the kernel.
